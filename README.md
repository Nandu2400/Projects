Title: USA House Price Prediction

#Project Overview:

This project aims to predict house prices in the USA based on various features such as average area income, house age, 

number of rooms, and population.

The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze housing data and provide price predictions.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains several important features:

Avg. Area Income: Average income of the residents in the area.

Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the area.

Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms per house.

Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms per house.

Area Population: Total population of the area.

Price: The target variable representing the price of the house.

Address: The address of the house, which may be used for spatial analysis.

The dataset is stored in a CSV file named USA_Housing_data.csv.

#Libraries Used:

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Warnings: To suppress unnecessary warnings.

#Steps Involved:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Feature Engineering: Renaming columns, handling missing values, and exploring the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of data, visualizing relationships, and checking for outliers.

Predictive Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on the given features.


#Future Work:

Experiment with different regression models to improve prediction accuracy.

Tune model hyperparameters to further optimize performance.

Implement cross-validation for more robust results.


#These are the key sections which invloved in the project:
